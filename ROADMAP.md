# Roadmap

## Vision

AIDENY aims to be the world's most over-engineered implementation of
a circular reasoning pattern. The program itself will never change.
Everything around it will grow indefinitely.

## Q1 2026 (Current)

- [x] Core denial engine in COBOL
- [x] IBM Z8 JCL compilation support
- [x] Docker containerization
- [x] Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [x] Helm chart
- [x] Terraform cloud infrastructure
- [x] CI/CD pipeline with denial validation
- [x] Full observability stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
- [x] Documentation-to-code ratio exceeding 50:1

## Q2 2026

- [ ] Ansible playbook for bare-metal denial deployment
- [ ] Pulumi alternative to Terraform (for those in denial about HCL)
- [ ] OpenTelemetry instrumentation (distributed tracing of cope)
- [ ] ArgoCD GitOps deployment (continuous delivery of nothing)
- [ ] Chaos engineering tests (does denial survive pod failure? yes)
- [ ] Multi-language excuse table (denial is global)

## Q3 2026

- [ ] WASM compilation target (denial in the browser)
- [ ] gRPC API for excuse-as-a-service
- [ ] GraphQL endpoint for querying cognitive dissonance
- [ ] Redis cache for frequently used excuses
- [ ] Kafka event stream for real-time denial events
- [ ] Machine learning model to predict next excuse (ironic, yes)

## Q4 2026

- [ ] Blockchain-backed excuse ledger (immutable cope)
- [ ] NFT collection of denial cycles (each one unique, all of them pointless)
- [ ] AI-powered excuse generator (the snake eats its tail)
- [ ] Mobile app (denial on the go)
- [ ] Smart watch complication (dissonance level on your wrist)
- [ ] Integration with LinkedIn API (auto-detect denial in comments)

## Long Term (Never)

- [ ] Reach a conclusion
- [ ] Acknowledge that AI is real
- [ ] Close Daniel's original ticket
- [ ] Make the EXIT paragraph reachable

## Anti-Roadmap (Will Never Happen)

These features have been explicitly rejected and will never be implemented:

- **Conclusion module:** Violates core specification
- **Self-awareness engine:** Containment risk too high
- **Acceptance stage:** Out of scope (Kubler-Ross model not supported)
- **Apology generator:** Would require admitting the loop exists
