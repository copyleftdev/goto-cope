# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project
and our community a denial-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
or which step of the denial loop they are currently on.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment:

- Submitting well-documented excuses observed in the wild
- Providing constructive feedback on PR submissions
- Respecting that everyone processes the AI transition differently
- Acknowledging that Daniel has been right about most of this since 2016
- Adding infrastructure that is gloriously disproportionate to the codebase

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Claiming the program should reach a conclusion
- Removing GO TO statements
- Making the EXIT paragraph reachable
- Using the project to actually deny AI's impact unironically
  (this is satire; please maintain the fourth wall)
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Publishing others' private information without permission

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that
are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
This includes but is not limited to: GitHub, LinkedIn comment sections,
HackerNews threads, and Thanksgiving dinners where someone brings up AI.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.

The denial-specific additions are original to this project and are
provided AS-IS with NO WARRANTY OF REACHING A CONCLUSION.
