## Description

<!-- What does this PR do? If it adds an excuse, describe where you observed it. -->

## Type of Change

- [ ] New excuse (`WS-EXCUSE-TABLE` expansion)
- [ ] New headline (`WS-HEADLINE-TABLE` expansion)
- [ ] Bug fix (the program accidentally reached a conclusion)
- [ ] Performance improvement (denial runs faster)
- [ ] Infrastructure (more YAML for a COBOL program)
- [ ] Documentation (the README is already longer than the program)

## Testing

- [ ] I compiled with `cobc -x -o aideny AIDENY.cbl`
- [ ] I ran the binary and confirmed no conclusion was reached
- [ ] I verified cognitive dissonance still accumulates
- [ ] I checked that all `GO TO` statements are intact
- [ ] I did NOT add an `EXIT` path that is reachable

## Denial Checklist

- [ ] This change does not introduce self-awareness
- [ ] This change does not acknowledge that AI might be real
- [ ] This change preserves the circular reasoning loop
- [ ] I have read Daniel Miessler's original specification
- [ ] I understand that this PR, like all PRs, will not lead to a conclusion

## Screenshots

<!-- If applicable, add screenshots of the denial engine output.
     If you have screenshots of the denial loop occurring in the wild
     (LinkedIn, HN, Twitter), those are even better. -->
