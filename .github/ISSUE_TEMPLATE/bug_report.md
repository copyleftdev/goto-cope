## Describe the Bug

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

## Expected Behavior

The denial engine should run in an infinite loop, accumulating
cognitive dissonance and never reaching a conclusion.

## Actual Behavior

<!-- What happened instead? Did the program... reach a conclusion?
     If so, this is a P0 severity incident. -->

## Environment

- **OS**: [e.g., z/OS 2.5, Ubuntu 24.04]
- **COBOL Compiler**: [e.g., IBM Enterprise COBOL V6.4, GnuCOBOL 3.2]
- **Hardware**: [e.g., IBM Z8, commodity x86, a laptop at Thanksgiving]
- **Denial Level**: [e.g., casual, committed, professional]

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Compile AIDENY.cbl
2. Run the binary
3. Observe [unexpected behavior]

## Additional Context

<!-- Note: If you are reporting that the program reached a conclusion,
     please include your full terminal output. This would be the first
     known instance and we need to study it carefully.

     Also: Are you sure it reached a conclusion? Or did you just
     stop reading the output? That's different. That's just
     Step 3 with extra steps. -->

## Is This Actually a Bug?

- [ ] Yes, the program deviated from the specification
- [ ] No, I just don't like the output (see: Step 1)
- [ ] I'm not sure (see: Step 3)
