# AIDENY — ShellCheck Configuration
# Linting rules for shell scripts in a COBOL project
# =============================================================
# There are no shell scripts in this project.
# But if there were, they'd be linted.
# That's the kind of project this is.

# Allow sourcing from paths determined at runtime
external-sources=true

# We're aware that some vars look unused. They're used in COBOL.
# ShellCheck doesn't know about COBOL. Few do.
