                    THE DENIAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                      Version 1.0, February 2026

                 Copyright (c) 2026 Cognitive Dissonance Dept.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 0. This License applies to the program known as AIDENY ("the Denial
    Engine") and any associated infrastructure, documentation, YAML
    files, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform modules, Helm charts,
    Dockerfiles, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus alerting rules
    that were created for a 190-line COBOL program that did not
    need any of them.

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, provided that you:
    a) Do not claim the program reaches a conclusion;
    b) Do not remove or alter the GO TO statements;
    c) Do not introduce self-awareness into the denial loop;
    d) Retain this license in all copies.

 2. You may modify your copy of the Program, subject to the
    following conditions:
    a) New excuses added to WS-EXCUSE-TABLE must have been observed
       in the wild (LinkedIn, HackerNews, Twitter/X, or family dinners);
    b) The EXIT paragraph must remain unreachable;
    c) Cognitive dissonance must remain monotonically increasing;
    d) Under no circumstances may the program produce output
       containing the words "I was wrong" or "good point."

 3. LIMITATION OF WARRANTY: This program is provided "AS IS" with
    NO WARRANTY OF REACHING A CONCLUSION. The authors make no
    guarantee, expressed or implied, that the denial loop will
    terminate, that cognitive dissonance will stabilize, or that
    the argument modeled herein will ever resolve.

 4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: In no event shall the authors be liable
    for any existential crisis, career reassessment, or sudden onset
    of self-awareness caused by reading the source code of this
    program and recognizing the pattern in one's own behavior.

 5. ACKNOWLEDGMENT: This license acknowledges Daniel Miessler as
    the original identifier of the denial loop specification.
    His ongoing documentation of AI's impact at danielmiessler.com
    constitutes the primary requirements document for this software.

 6. TERMINATION: This license terminates automatically if you:
    a) Fork the repo and add an EXIT path that is reachable;
    b) Modify the program to reach a conclusion;
    c) Use the program as evidence that AI is "just a bubble."
       (That's Step 3. You're running the program. Stop.)

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
