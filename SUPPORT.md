# Getting Support

## Before You Ask

Please verify that your issue is not one of the following known behaviors:

- The program does not reach a conclusion → **Working as intended**
- Cognitive dissonance keeps going up → **Working as intended**
- The loop never terminates → **Working as intended**
- The infrastructure seems excessive → **Working as intended**
- You feel personally called out → **Working as intended**

## Frequently Needed Support

### "The program won't stop"

That's the point. Set `WS-MAX-CYCLES` to a finite number for demo
purposes, or press Ctrl+C to intervene manually — which, metaphorically,
is also what Daniel has been trying to do since 2016.

### "I want to add an excuse but it's over 50 characters"

COBOL's `PIC X(50)` is non-negotiable. Brevity is the soul of cope.
Edit your excuse down. If the real-world version of the excuse is also
long-winded, that's realistic, but the mainframe doesn't care.

### "Can I use this at work?"

You probably already are. Check your Slack channels.

### "Is this making fun of me?"

This program makes fun of a *pattern*, not a person. If you see yourself
in the output, that's between you and `WS-COGNITIVE-LOAD`.

## Commercial Support

There is no commercial support for the denial engine.
However, if your enterprise requires a support contract for a joke
COBOL program, that itself is a strong indication that the denial
loop has reached the procurement department. Please file an issue
with the label `enterprise-cope`.
