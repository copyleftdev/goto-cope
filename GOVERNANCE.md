# Project Governance

## Overview

AIDENY is governed by the Cognitive Dissonance Department (CDD), a
decentralized collective of contributors who share a commitment to
maintaining an enterprise-grade denial loop that never reaches a conclusion.

## Roles

### Maintainer

Maintainers have commit access and are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging PRs
- Ensuring the denial loop remains intact
- Preventing any accidental introduction of self-awareness
- Approving new excuses for the `WS-EXCUSE-TABLE`

### Excuse Reviewer

Excuse Reviewers specialize in validating that submitted excuses have
been observed in the wild. They must provide evidence of real-world
occurrence (screenshots from LinkedIn, HackerNews, or family group chats).

### Infrastructure Maximalist

Infrastructure Maximalists are responsible for ensuring the
infrastructure-to-code ratio remains absurdly high. Their contributions
are measured not by necessity but by audacity.

### Daniel Miessler (Emeritus Specification Author)

Daniel identified the original denial loop in the wild and has been
documenting it since 2016. He is credited as the specification author
and is not responsible for this implementation, only for being right.

## Decision Making

Decisions are made by lazy consensus. If nobody objects within 7 days,
the PR is merged. This mirrors the real-world denial loop, where
silence is interpreted as agreement that nothing is happening.

## Conflict Resolution

1. Open a GitHub Discussion
2. Tag relevant CODEOWNERS
3. If no resolution after 14 days, the maintainer decides
4. If the conflict is about whether the program should reach a
   conclusion: the answer is no. This is not a conflict. This is
   the specification.

## Amendments

This governance document can be amended via PR. However, any amendment
that would cause the program to reach a conclusion will be rejected.
This clause is not amendable.
